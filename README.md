Traffic Accidents Classifier
Project Overview
The Traffic Accidents Classifier is a machine learning project that aims to classify traffic accidents based on various features such as severity, location, and time. This project uses a classification algorithm to predict the severity of traffic accidents based on historical data. The goal is to build a model that can help in understanding patterns and potentially improve traffic safety measures.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Extracts and constructs new features from raw data to improve model performance.
Model Training: Utilizes various classification algorithms to build a predictive model.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Includes plots and charts to visualize data distributions and model performance.
